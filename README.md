# This will guide you to get started with Admin application.

## Problem Context

You work at a startup that is building an interface for admins to see and delete users. The users will be provided via an API. Your job is to build out a working UI. See image below for reference.

We have to manage the user list data.

## Run npm install to install all the dependency of this project

#### `npm install`

## Run npm test to test the Admin application

#### `npm test`

## This application helps to track the user data and make changes to user data.

The user data page will render the serach bar at the top and we can search the user by name, email and role.
Once user types the search query and have to press enter to execute the search query.

In the middle of the screen we will have the user list and each page will have 10 users per page and the last page will have the remaining number of users.

We can select all the users row by clicking on the checkbox at the top left in the user list title row(which is the very first row).

We can delete all the selected users by clicking on the delete selected button at the bottom.

we can edit/delete user at place, one at a time.
